## Building
Note: You should have at least `cmake v3.15` and a Generator (i.e Ninja) to build and run this. *SFML* will be added as a dependency just by doing the configuration using steps below.
Run this, from the Terminos_2D directory:

    > cmake -S . -B "build" -G [Generator i.e "Ninja"]
    > cmake --build build
    > cd build
    > ninja
